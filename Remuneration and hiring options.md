# Hiring options #

The first thing to consider related to engineer remuneration is what type of employee they are. There are three broad categories, each with pros and cons:

- Full-time employee
- Development shop
- Individual contractor

Full time employee benefits:

- Dedicated and proprietary
- Highest level of continuity
- Better communication, especially if they are co-located
- Cheaper than most other options
- Able to exert more control over them

Development shop benefits:

- Hiring is much more efficient
- Multiple skills are accessible
- Likely to have a higher level of continuity than individual contractors
- They are able to manage load across various projects
- Low commitment up front

Individual contractor benefits: 

- Cheaper than development shop
- Lower commitment than full time employee
- good for simpler/1-time projects
- unique person/talent

# Motivating Engineers #

Engineers are motivated by:

Mastery - Give them the time to learn new skills and things that interest them
Purpose - Give them the opportunity to work on something that they believe in 

Monetary remuneration is generally less important than these two factors but you must be able to meet the market

# Compensation Guidelines #

Hourly rates for the different developer types are roughly as follows:

full-time: $95/hour
dev shop: $250/hour
contractor: $120-150/hour

For full time employees, salaries are:

College graduate: $95,000
3 years experience: $120,000 - $140,000
