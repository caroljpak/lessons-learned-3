<h1>There are two types great engineers:</h1>
1. Great product engineers: they find better ways of solving the problem and help you build the product. These engineers are most compatible with business school graduates because they are great at designing a solution to business problems.
2. Great engineering engineers: they are great at actually solving the problem with either a large scale build or novel technology. These engineers are better lead by actual engineers because their skillset is better used for solving complex engineering problems.

<h1>Questions to Ask</h1>
The best way to find a great engineer is to have a skilled advisor; however, there are some questions to ask that can weed out 70% of the average engineers even if the person asking doesn't understand the answers. The question is as follows:
What ______ do you use? What did you compare it with? Why did you pick it?
Fill in the blank with the following:
- Version Control System (acceptible answers: GIT/Mercurial/TFS, Subversion is pretty dated)
- Unit Testing Tool (extra credit if they use TDD or BDD)
- Framework

For the most part, if the engineer has a solid answer to the above, he or she is reasonably qualified. Another easy filter is whether or not this engineer has a github account, though it is hard to determine the quality of the engineer by just looking at their github account. 

<h1>Languages</h1>
As for languages, the rule of thumb is to let the engineer pick which language he/she likes to work in. However, if the engineer only knows PHP, it is a bit too basic. He/she should be at least fluent in those RUBY/PYTHON, and extra credit if they know SCAVA, CLOJACC, HASKELL, and GO. However, if he/she is very interested in HASKELL, they could be too academic in their purpose.

<h1>Location</h1>
The benefits of being local are the in-person interactions. The benefits of hiring in the US are cultural and communication normals. The benefit of hiring regionally is working in the same time zones. The benefit of hiring globally is looking for the right talent, and sometimes price. 

<h1>Other Tips</h1>
In general, it is not the best idea to hire undergrads if you can avoid it. Also, full stack developers are kind of a unicorn (master of front and backend programming). Most people who claim to be are not. Last, you should think of finding the right engineer the same way as dating...
