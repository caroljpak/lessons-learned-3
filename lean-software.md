## Lean Software Development

For tech startups operating on a minimal budget, lean software development is a critical concept.
Lean can essentially be boiled down to one simple idea: eliminate anything in the software development 
process that isn't adding value.  By focusing only on necessary aspects of the process and avoiding waste, 
nascent firms can be more efficient and better position themselves to bring products to the market quickly and cheaply.  

Lean can be summarized by the following principles:

1. Eliminate Waste
2. Build Quality In
3. Create Knowledge
4. Defer Commitment
5. Deliver Fast
6. Respect People
7. Optimize The Whole


Below is a mind map of lean software development.  The map shows the major ideas connected to lean: People, Speed, Knowledge, Quality, History, Principles, Values and Waste.  Branching out from each of these are additional ideas, which together combine to give an overall picture of the main themes and associations behind the lean concept.
