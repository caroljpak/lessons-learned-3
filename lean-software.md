# Lean Software Development

For tech startups operating on a minimal budget, lean software development is a critical concept.
Lean can essentially be boiled down to one simple idea: eliminate anything in the software development 
process that isn't adding value.  By focusing only on necessary aspects of the process and avoiding waste, 
nascent firms can be more efficient and better position themselves to bring products to the market quickly and cheaply.  

## Principles of Lean
Lean can be summarized by the following principles:

1. Eliminate Waste
  - Waste in software development can come in any of the following forms: partially done work, extra features, relearning,
  hand-offs (passing work from one person to another), delays, task switching and defects.
2. Build Quality In
  - Make quality a priority from the beginning
  - Use Test-Driven Development to ensure quality is maintained throughout the development process
3. Create Knowledge
  - Consider programming in pairs so that at least two people are familiar with all implemented code
  - Do code reviews, create detailed documentation and wikis, hold training sessions
4. Defer Commitment
  - Decide as late as possible, particularly for decisions that are irreversible, but don't decide too late and cause delays
  - Making decisions too early can result in waste, as technical requirements inevitable change mid-project
5. Deliver Fast
  - Don't over-engineer or fixate on future requirements that may never arise; instead build a simple solution and get it
  to market quickly.
6. Respect People
  - Respond to people promptly, listen attentively and encourage them to have their say
  - Empower people and give them the responsibility to make decisions about their work
7. Optimize The Whole
  - Optimize the whole value stream, not just individual functions or teams

## Example of Lean
Common Scenario:  
A customer wants some new features ‘yesterday’. 
Developers hear: get it done fast, at all costs! 
Result: sloppy changes are made to the code. Complexity  of the code base increases. Number of defects in the code  increases.

Solution:
Optimize the Whole by organizing teams into complete, multi-disciplined, co-located product teams that have all the roles and skills they need to deliver a request from start to finish, without reference to other teams.

## Lean Mind Map

Below is a mind map of lean software development.  The map shows the major ideas connected to lean: People, Speed, Knowledge, Quality, History, Principles, Values and Waste.  Branching out from each of these are additional ideas, which together combine to give an overall picture of the main themes and associations behind the lean concept.
