#  Takeaways: #

1. What is Github?
   - GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. There are three major features that make Github so powerfulâ€“ forks,
     pull requests and merges.

2. What is a repository?
   - Github is a central location in which data is stored and managed. Github allows both public and private repositories, with
     the ability to add contributors to any repository. 
   
3. Why do coders use Github?
   - It allows anyone to store code, keep track of changes to code, share code, and work with others on code. Github also allows
     coders to copy and edit code that they don't have access to, and fosters a strong community of open-source code developers.
   
4. How to understand a user's Github profile?
   - You can view and assess a user's contributions, followers, and repositories. Generally, it's not easy for the average
     person to inference the experience level of a coder by just looking at his/her Github profile but every good developer 
     should have one and be active on it or he/she is probably not very interested in code.

5. The importance of forking 
   - "A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the
     original project." Forks allow you to propose changes to someone else's project or use someone else's project as a starting
     point for your own idea.

     If you'd like to propose any changes to a repository, fork the repository, edit as desired, and submit a pull request to
     the project owner.
