#Minimum viable Products and Hacking It

As an entrepreneur, do everything you can cheaply, sooner, easier<br> 
Think lean - don't create or do anything if it's not necesary<br>
Embrace the idea of Minimum Viable Product - Try to make do!<br>
Side note: the word "product" often carries with it a lot of red tape (denotes finished good, etc.), managers may be  better served by referring to MVPs as "experiments". This simple change in terminology can significantly lessen the time it takes to develop an MVP. <br>

There are a few different types of MVPs/Experiments:<br>
1) landing page - to test interest, see who views and signs up<br>
2) video showcasing concept<br>
3) email only or concierge<br>
MVPs (without building up full code)  will help make sure there is demand, that you'll have cusotmers to buy your product<br>
Make sure there is product to market fit - don't build something until you figure out a need and demand<br>

Ask: what can you do quickly without labor, without capital, without engineers? <br>
Find ways to hack it!<br>
The most important part of managing a start-up in the early  stages is minimizing cycle time and maximizing learning, and embracing MVPs is the way to do so<br>

Once you determine need, you still need to ask:<br>
Can I do what I need with an existing third party resource or code? <br>
Eliminate the need for developers or designers. <br>
Use 3rd party resources that have built-in functionality and see if you can make do<br>
Ex. [Shopify] (http://www.shopify.com) for e-commerce or [Squarespace] (http://www.squarespace.com) for websites<br>

Once a version of MVP is created, keep refining and defining what else you need. Eventually you create a Minimum Marketing Product (MMP) that a sales team can utilize. In this way, you create the most lean version of the code you need and get to market sooner. This is a core tenet of agile programming!
